# UCLA Law COVID-19 Behind Bars Data

## Background

The [UCLA Law COVID-19 Behind Bars Data
Project](https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/), launched in March 2020,
tracks the spread and impact of COVID-19 in American carceral facilities
and advocates for greater transparency and accountability around the
pandemic response of the carceral system. Since March, we have been
collecting and reporting facility-level data on COVID-19 in prisons,
jails, and other correctional centers.

We also collect information about pandemic-related prison and jail
releases, legal filings and court orders bearing on the safety of
incarcerated people, and grassroots organizing campaigns and fundraisers
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1X6uJkXXS-O6eePLxw2e4JeRtM41uPZ2eRcOA_HkPVTk/edit#gid=1641553906).

## Our Process

Our core dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and
tests across more than 1,500 state, federal, and county facilities. We
maintain this dataset by scraping and standardizing data from more than
80 sources. We scrape this data 3-4 times each week, although
correctional agencies vary in how often they update their data. Our
[scraper production
code](https://github.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/covid19_behind_bars_scrapers)
and [more detailed
documentation](https://uclalawcovid19behindbars.github.io/covid19-behind-bars-public-docs/scraper_documentation/)
are available on GitHub.

The majority of the facilities that we collect data on fall under state
jurisdiction, where COVID-19 data is reported on state Department of
Correction (DOC) websites. We also collect data from federal prisons
reported by the [Federal Bureau of
Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/) and from several large county
jail systems – including [Los
Angeles](https://lasd.org/covid19updates/), [New York
City](https://doccs.ny.gov/doccs-covid-19-report),
[Philadelphia](https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/testing-and-data/#/philadelphia-prisons-covid-19-data),
[Maricopa
County](https://www.maricopa.gov/5574/COVID-19-in-County-Jails), [Orange
County](https://ocsheriff.gov/about-ocsd/covid-19/covid-19-oc-jails),
[Cook
County](https://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-ccdoc/), and
[Hennepin
County](https://www.hennepinsheriff.org/jail-warrants/jail-information/COVID-19).

### Number of Facilities by Jurisdiction

<img src="README_files/figure-gfm/fac-by-jurisdiction-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We are continuously adding to and refining our scrapers. Where possible,
we have also retrospectively added COVID-19 data for facilities using
digital archives. We are currently in the process of cleaning our
historical scraped data and integrating population data to more readily
compute COVID-19 rates across facilities over the course of the
pandemic. This data is available for several states [on GitHub
here](https://github.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/historical-data/tree/main/data).
We are also developing an R package
[`behindbarstools`](https://github.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/behindbarstools),
which includes a variety of functions to help pull, clean, wrangle, and
visualize our data.

## Our Data

Our core dataset includes the following metrics – reported separately
for incarcerated people and staff at the facility level:

  - Cumulative COVID-19 cases
  - Cumulative COVID-19 deaths
  - Active COVID-19 cases
  - COVID-19 tests administered

Not all jurisdictions report COVID-19 metrics at the facility level.
Some DOCs only report statewide totals, and others do not report any
data for certain metrics. Authorities also vary dramatically in how they
define the metrics that they report. We do our best to standardize these
variables, but comparing data across jurisdictions and over time should
be done with caution.

**Note**: Jurisdictions are continuously updating how, where, and
whether they update their data. We do our best to accurately collect as
much data as possible, but our data availability is subject to change.
The maps below show the data that we currently include in our core
dataset. This typically corresponds to the data that DOCs report on
their websites, but there may be instances when DOC report data that we
are unable to scrape.

### Data Availability for Incarcerated Residents in State Prisons

The maps below summarize our data availability for our four core metrics
among incarcerated people in state prisons For example, [California’s
DOC](https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/covid19/population-status-tracking/)
reports facility-level data on cumulative COVID-19 cases for residents,
while [Florida’s DOC](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/comm/covid-19.html) only
reports statewide totals. The [Federal Bureau of
Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/) reports facility-level data
on cumulative cases and deaths, but not active cases or tests
administered.

### Data Availability for Staff in State Prisons

The maps below summarize our data availability for cumulative COVID-19
cases and deaths among staff in state prisons We try to include data
only for correctional staff who work within facility walls and exclude
administrative staff. When agencies don’t distinguish between different
types of staff in their reporting, we include data for all reported
staff.
