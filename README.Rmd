# UCLA Law COVID-19 Behind Bars Data 

## Background 
The [UCLA Law COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project](https://uclacovidbehindbars.org/), launched in March 2020, tracks the spread and impact of COVID-19 in American carceral facilities and advocates for greater transparency and accountability around the pandemic response of the carceral system. Since March, we have been collecting and reporting facility-level data on COVID-19 in prisons, jails, and other correctional centers. 

We also collect information about pandemic-related prison and jail releases, legal filings and court orders bearing on the safety of incarcerated people, and grassroots organizing campaigns and fundraisers [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1X6uJkXXS-O6eePLxw2e4JeRtM41uPZ2eRcOA_HkPVTk/edit#gid=1641553906).

## Our Process  
Our core dataset includes information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and tests across more than 1,500 state, federal, and county facilities. We maintain this dataset by scraping and standardizing data from more than 80 sources. We scrape this data 3-4 times each week, although correctional agencies vary in how often they update their data. Our [scraper production code](https://github.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/covid19_behind_bars_scrapers) and [more detailed documentation](https://uclalawcovid19behindbars.github.io/covid19-behind-bars-public-docs/scraper_documentation/) are available on GitHub. 

The majority of the facilities that we collect data on fall under state jurisdiction, where COVID-19 data is reported on state Department of Correction (DOC) websites. We also collect data from federal prisons reported by the [Federal Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/) and from several large county jail systems – including [Los Angeles](https://lasd.org/covid19updates/), [New York City](https://doccs.ny.gov/doccs-covid-19-report), [Philadelphia](https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/testing-and-data/#/philadelphia-prisons-covid-19-data), [Maricopa County](https://www.maricopa.gov/5574/COVID-19-in-County-Jails), [Orange County](https://ocsheriff.gov/about-ocsd/covid-19/covid-19-oc-jails), [Cook County](https://www.cookcountysheriff.org/covid-19-cases-at-ccdoc/), and [Hennepin County](https://www.hennepinsheriff.org/jail-warrants/jail-information/COVID-19).  

``` {r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(behindbarstools)
library(tidyverse)
```

``` {r load, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load latest data 
scrape_df <- behindbarstools::read_scrape_data()
```

### Number of Facilities by Jurisdiction

``` {r fac-by-jurisdiction, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=1.5, fig.align="center", dpi=500}
# Plot facilities by jurisdiction 
scrape_df %>% 
    mutate(jurisdiction = stringr::str_to_title(jurisdiction)) %>% 
    group_by(jurisdiction) %>% 
    count() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = jurisdiction, y = n)) + 
    geom_segment(
        aes(x = jurisdiction, xend = jurisdiction, y = 0, yend = n), 
        size = 1.5, 
        color = "#4C6788") + 
    geom_point(
        color = "#4C6788", size = 4.0) + 
    geom_text(
        aes(label = scales::comma(n)), 
        color = "#555526", 
        size = 3.5, 
        hjust = -0.5, vjust = -0.8) + 
    coord_flip() + 
    scale_y_continuous(
        label = scales::comma, 
        limits = c(0, 1500)) + 
    theme_behindbars(base_size = 14) + 
    theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) 
```

We are continuously adding to and refining our scrapers. Where possible, we have also retrospectively added COVID-19 data for facilities using digital archives. We are currently in the process of cleaning our historical scraped data and integrating  population data to more readily compute COVID-19 rates across facilities over the course of the pandemic. This data is available for several states [on GitHub here](https://github.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/historical-data/tree/main/data). We are also developing an R package [`behindbarstools`](https://github.com/uclalawcovid19behindbars/behindbarstools), which includes a variety of functions to help pull, clean, wrangle, and visualize our data.  

## Our Data 
Our core dataset includes the following metrics – reported separately for incarcerated people and staff at the facility level: 

* Cumulative COVID-19 cases 
* Cumulative COVID-19 deaths 
* Active COVID-19 cases 
* COVID-19 tests administered 

Not all jurisdictions report COVID-19 metrics at the facility level. Some DOCs only report statewide totals, and others do not report any data for certain metrics. Authorities also vary dramatically in how they define the metrics that they report. We do our best to standardize these variables, but comparing data across jurisdictions and over time should be done with caution.

**Note**: Jurisdictions are continuously updating how, where, and whether they update their data. We do our best to accurately collect as much data as possible, but our data availability is subject to change. The maps below show the data that we currently include in our core dataset. This typically corresponds to the data that DOCs report on their websites, but there may be instances when DOC report data that we are unable to scrape. 

``` {r map-setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

spdf <- geojsonio::geojson_read("README_files/us_states_hexgrid.geojson", what = "sp")

spdf@data = spdf@data %>% 
    mutate(google_name = gsub(" \\(United States\\)", "", google_name))

spdf_fortified <- broom::tidy(spdf, region = "google_name")

centers <- cbind.data.frame(data.frame(
    rgeos::gCentroid(spdf, byid = TRUE), 
    id = spdf@data$iso3166_2))

# Set plotting aesthetics 
fill_bb <- c("facility" = "#D7790F", 
             "statewide" = "#82CAA4",

### Data Availability for Incarcerated Residents in State Prisons  
The maps below summarize our data availability for our four core metrics among incarcerated people in state prisons For example, [California's DOC](https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/covid19/population-status-tracking/) reports facility-level data on cumulative COVID-19 cases for residents, while [Florida's DOC](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/comm/covid-19.html) only reports statewide totals. The [Federal Bureau of Prisons](https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/) reports facility-level data on cumulative cases and deaths, but not active cases or tests administered. 

``` {r resident-maps, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6.5, fig.align="center", dpi=500}
# Residents coverage maps 
map_Residents.Confirmed <- 
    plot_hex_map(get_plotting_data("Residents.Confirmed")) + 
    labs(title = "Cumulative COVID-19 Cases")

map_Residents.Deaths <- 
    plot_hex_map(get_plotting_data("Residents.Deaths")) + 
    labs(title = "Cumulative COVID-19 Deaths")

map_Residents.Active <- 
    plot_hex_map(get_plotting_data("Residents.Active")) + 
    labs(title = "Active COVID-19 Cases")

map_Residents.Tadmin <- 
    plot_hex_map(get_plotting_data("Residents.Tadmin")) + 
    labs(title = "COVID-19 Tests Administered")

ggpubr::ggarrange(map_Residents.Confirmed, map_Residents.Deaths, 
                  map_Residents.Active, map_Residents.Tadmin, 
                  common.legend = TRUE)
```

### Data Availability for Staff in State Prisons 
The maps below summarize our data availability for cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths among staff in state prisons We try to include data only for correctional staff who work within facility walls and exclude administrative staff. When agencies don't distinguish between different types of staff in their reporting, we include data for all reported staff.

``` {r staff-maps, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=3.5, fig.align="center", dpi=500}
# Staff coverage maps 
map_Staff.Confirmed <- 
    plot_hex_map(get_plotting_data("Staff.Confirmed")) + 
    labs(title = "Cumulative COVID-19 Cases")

map_Staff.Deaths <- 
    plot_hex_map(get_plotting_data("Staff.Deaths")) + 
    labs(title = "Cumulative COVID-19 Deaths")

ggpubr::ggarrange(map_Staff.Confirmed, map_Staff.Deaths, 
                  common.legend = TRUE)
```
